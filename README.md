## Welcome to the HYG star database archive.  The most current version of the database will always be found here.

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

The AT-HYG database is being moved into its own repository: "ATHYG-Database". This is currently also hosted on Github at https://github.com/astronexus/ATHYG-Database. This repo is live and will have all future updates to AT-HYG.

No updates to the new AT-HYG files will be posted here, and they will soon be removed entirely.

### Database Collections

#### HYG (Hipparcos-Yale-Gliese)
##### Directory /hyg - Currently 119,614 stars

This is the original focus of this data collection. HYG combines every identifiable star in the HIPPARCOS, Yale Bright Star, and Gliese (nearby star) catalogs into a combined dataset of the stars' currently best-known positions, brightnesses, spectral types, and various additional catalog IDs such as traditional names and Bayer designations.

The current HYG catalog is v3.7. v3.0 was originally compiled in 2014. There have been a few small changes since then, mostly to add additional ID/label information and to correct a few errors. The most significant was a change in March 2023, to merge a PR that added the official star names from the IAU Working Group on Star Names in 2018, as well as to add a few additional old catalog designations for some nearby stars (e.g., "Ross 128") that may as well be proper names at this point.

See hyg/README.md for details about the HYG catalog.

#### Miscellany
##### Directory /misc

The catalog misc/dso.csv contains a list of approximately 220K deep-sky objects, mostly galaxies, used in applications on https://www.astronexus.com.
