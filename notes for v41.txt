These Flamsteed IDs have multiple stars associated with them, including the following named ones. Most of the named stars are fairly wide doubles (20-100 arcsec) so there are use cases where they should be labeled _similarly_.
The proposal is to add " B" to the second/dimmer component so that they will be labeled consistently in client apps.

e.g. without that change, the two stars in 51 Boo (the first example below with a proper name) would _tend_ to get labeled as:

if displaying the primary label:
    "Alkalurops" + "μ2 Boo"
if displaying a primary name + a secondary ID:
    "Alkalurops (μ1 Boo)" + "μ2 Boo (51 Boo)"

when both stars are in a list, or displayed in a charting app. That's because normally labels would go from the most common names to less common ones, ending finally at something like a Tycho-2 or Gaia ID. This app behavior isn't *universal*, but it's common. Both Endeavour and Uraniborg do something like it when labeling bright stars or nearby stars, for example.

With this change, they'd get matching labels:

"Alkalurops" + "Alkalurops B"
    - or -
"Alkalurops (μ1 Boo)" + "Alkalurops - (μ2 Boo)"

30  Ari 2   
17  Boo 2   
51  Boo 2   Alkalurops === = mu1+mu2 Boo, double is right on the edge of naked-eye visibility, very wide in telescope. Add "Alkalurops B".
12  Cap 2   
48  Cnc 2   
24  Com 2   
12  CVn 2   Cor Caroli === alpha1+alpha2 CVn, not naked eye double, wide in telescope. Add "Cor Caroli B". Note that Cor Caroli (no "B"), the brighter star, is the alpha-2 (!) Bayer component, which is not ideal.
6   Cyg 2   Albireo === beta Cyg, not naked eye double, very wide in telescope. Add "Albireo B".
61  Cyg 2   
12  Del 2   
31  Dra 2   Dziban === psi Dra, not naked eye double, very wide in telescope. Add "Dziban B".
100 Her 2   
7   Her 2   Marsic === kappa Her, not naked eye double, wide in telescope, components in HIP are widely separated in space (over 5x difference in distance) but not clear if this is accurate. Add "MArsic B".

74  Psc 2   
77  Psc 2   
86  Psc 2   Revati === zeta Psc, not naked-eye double, wide in telescope, components in HIP are widely separated in space. Add "Revati B".
2   Pup 2   
8   Sco 2   Acrab === beta1+beta2 Sco, not naked-eye double. Add "Acrab B".
63  Ser 2   Alya === theta1+theta2 Ser, not naked eye double, wide in telescope. Add "Alya B".
8   Sex 2   
53  UMa 2   Alula Australis == xi UMa; not naked-eye double, fairly close in telescope. Add "Alula Australis B".
65  UMa 2   

others found in a different query:

66 Gem = Castor (added "B")
36 Oph = Guniibuu (also added "B")
42 Com = alpha Com = Diadem; stars are very close, not worth labeling them separately
21 Dra = mu Dra = Alrakis: this is kind of a strange case. Problematic b/c the proper name is associated with the _dimmer_ component, so just slapping "Alrakis B" on the other is not great. Also, like alpha Com (Diadem), it's much closer than most of the other doubles. This may justify changing the official name to the other component and then adding the "B" component.
